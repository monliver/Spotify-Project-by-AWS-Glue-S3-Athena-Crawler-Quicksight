# Spotify-Project-by-AWS-Glue-S3-Athena-Crawler-Quicksight

This project involves building an ETL pipeline using AWS services to analyze Spotify data. The process begins with storing raw data in AWS S3, followed by using AWS Glue for data transformation and cleaning. We then employ AWS Glue Crawlers to create a catalog of the data. The transformed data is stored back in S3 as a data warehouse. AWS Athena is used to run SQL queries on the transformed data, allowing for efficient data retrieval and analysis. The final step involves using AWS QuickSight for data visualization, providing insights into music trends, album popularity, and artist performance.

The key technologies used include AWS S3 for scalable storage, AWS Glue for data transformation, AWS Glue Crawlers for metadata management, AWS Athena for querying the data, and AWS QuickSight for visualization. The workflow ensures that data is seamlessly transformed and analyzed in a structured manner, enabling detailed insights and reporting. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Spotify data, focusing on various metrics such as track popularity, album releases, and artist genres, ultimately supporting better decision-making and strategic planning.
