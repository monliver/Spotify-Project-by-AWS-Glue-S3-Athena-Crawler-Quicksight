# Spotify-Project-by-AWS-Glue-S3-Athena-Crawler-Quicksight

This project involves creating an ETL pipeline using AWS services to process and analyze Spotify data. Raw data is stored in AWS S3 and transformed using AWS Glue. AWS Glue Crawlers are used to catalog the data, and SQL queries are run with AWS Athena for analysis. The processed data is visualized using AWS QuickSight, providing insights into music trends and artist performance. The project aims to efficiently handle large datasets and deliver actionable analytics for better decision-making.
